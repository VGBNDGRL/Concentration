    - We are making this a struct, not a class
    - What is the difference? A struct and class in Swift are VERY similar.
        There are TWO major differences:
            1) Structs have NO inheritance (makes them simple)
            2) Structs are VALUE types, Classes are REFERENCE types
                - What does this mean? A VALUE type, when you pass it as an argument, put it in an array, assign it to another var, it gets COPIED
                - Copy-on-write semantics
                - Classes are REFERENCE types: Object lives in the HEAP, you pass pointers to the same object

    /* What is a static func? We ask the Card Type for an ID, this is like a global func*/

        identifierFactory += 1

    // We are creating an init so I don't always have to initialize all of the vars
    init() {
        self.identifier = Card.getUniqueIdentifier()
    }
    /* Does our card need an its emoji? NO becuase this is UI independent, we are only worried about how the card BEHAVES, how the game WORKS. MODEL NOT UI!*/
